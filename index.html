        Chicken biryani is a flavorful and aromatic South Asian dish made with layers of marinated chicken, fragrant basmati rice, 
        and a blend of spices such as cumin, cardamom, and cloves. Cooked with saffron, fried onions, and fresh herbs like mint and 
        cilantro, it offers a rich, savory taste with a hint of heat. Traditionally cooked in a sealed pot to trap steam, chicken biryani 
        is a festive and beloved meal enjoyed across India, Pakistan, and beyond.

            Hot chocolate is a warm, comforting drink made by mixing cocoa powder 
            or melted chocolate with milk or water and sweetening it with sugar. 
            Rich, creamy, and smooth, it's often topped with whipped cream, marshmallows, 
            or a sprinkle of cocoa or cinnamon for extra indulgence. Perfect for cold days, 
            hot chocolate is enjoyed worldwide as a cozy treat that combines deep chocolate 
            flavor with soothing warmth.

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            New York cheesecake is a rich, dense, and creamy dessert 
            made with a smooth cream cheese filling, typically set atop 
            a buttery graham cracker crust. Unlike lighter cheesecakes, 
            it features extra eggs and sometimes sour cream, giving it a 
            luxurious, velvety texture with a slight tang. Often baked in 
            a water bath to prevent cracks, it's a classic indulgence, best 
            served plain or with a topping of fresh berries, fruit compote, 
            or a drizzle of chocolate.
