    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        New York cheesecake is a rich, dense, and creamy dessert 
        made with a smooth cream cheese filling, typically set atop 
        a buttery graham cracker crust. Unlike lighter cheesecakes, 
        it features extra eggs and sometimes sour cream, giving it a 
        luxurious, velvety texture with a slight tang. Often baked in 
        a water bath to prevent cracks, it's a classic indulgence, best 
        served plain or with a topping of fresh berries, fruit compote, 
        or a drizzle of chocolate.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the Crust</b>
            <ul>
                <l>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C).</l>
                <l>Mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter in a bowl until well combined.</l>
                <l>Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.</l>
                <l>Bake for 10 minutes, then let it cool while you make the filling.</l>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Make the Filling</b>
            <ul>
                <l>In a large bowl, beat softened cream cheese until smooth.</l>
                <l>Add sugar and mix until creamy.</l>
                <l>Blend in sour cream, vanilla extract, and flour (if using).</l>
                <l>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed just until combined (don't overmix).</l>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Assemble and Bake</b>
            <ul>
                <l>Pour the filling over the cooled crust.</l>
                <l>Tap the pan gently on the counter to release air bubbles.</l>
                <l>Optional: Place the pan in a water bath (wrap the pan in foil to prevent leaks).</l>
                <l>Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly.</l>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Cool Gradually</b>
            <ul>
                <l>Turn off the oven, crack the door, and let the cheesecake cool inside for 1 hour.</l>
                <l>Then transfer to the counter to cool to room temperature.</l>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Chill and Serve</b>
            <ul>
                <l>Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</l>
                <l>Run a knife around the edge before releasing the springform pan.</l>
                <l>Top with fruit, sauce, or whipped cream, if desired.</l>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
